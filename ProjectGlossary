##  Glossary

### Auction: By "Auction", in our business, we specify a sale method where one or multiple users can offer bids (see "Bid" below) for a specific item
while the auction is active. When the auction ends, the user with the highest bid will be the one who acquires the item.


### Bid: A monetary offer for an auctioned item.

### Bidder: Refers to a user who is partaking in an auction.

### Book: A specific type of Item. Per business stipulations, "Books published since 1970 are expected to have an ISBN 10-digit code (13-digit since 2007)".
Alternatively, "Some books may have both 10-digit and 13-digit codes" or none of the above.

### Buyer: A User who engages with a Seller to acquire a listed item strictly through a DirectSale.

### Cart: The haul of items a User picks out from one or multiple Listings (only DirectSales). The Cart may also be empty.

### Community: The overarching relationships established by the digital group created through and by MiteLovers' Users.

### DirectSale: Our business' other sale method, besides Auction. The Listings available for DirectSale on a User's Cart can be purchased directly from Sellers
without going into an Auction. DirectSale Listings have a fixed price.

### Item: The attributes of the physical copy found in a Listing. This may include weight, number of pages and dimensions.

### ItemDescription (BibliographicalData): The literary information of an Item. Regardless of the differences between different physical copies
found across Listings, the data found in ItemDescription always points to the same Item. (Example: despite different editions or condition, The Hobbit
is always written by JRR Tolkien and released in 1937).

### Listing: The Item a User, as a Seller, has available for sale, either through Auction or DirectSale.

### LogisticServices: External services to our business that aid in distribution and delivery of purchased Items (to be updated).

### Magazine: The other type of Item, besides Book. Per business stipulations, "Magazines published since 1976 are expected to have an International
Standard Serial Number (ISSN) code" or no code at all.

### Seller: A User who has a single or multiples Listings with Items on offer.

### SupportService: Complementary services such as Appraisal Services and others (to be disclosed in the near future).

### Transaction: The act where Users exchange a listed Item for the agreed upon price (a Transaction may be finalized
via multiple means).

### User: Per business stipulations, "A non-registered user can search and browse sales". However, "only registered users can see the prices
and buy or place bids". As such, a registered User may occupy the role of a Buyer, Seller or Bidder.
